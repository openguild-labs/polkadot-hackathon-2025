<h3 align="center">WESTPOOL</h3>

Welcome to WestPool, our revolutionary decentralized application (dApp) built to enhance the Web3 ecosystem, particularly the Polkadot and Kusama parachain ecosystems. This project leverages Bifrost's vAsset technology and the PolkaVM on the Westend network to create a robust launchpool staking platform and a cutting-edge premarket for trading project tokens.

## Features

### 1. **Launchpool Staking**

Our launchpool staking feature introduces a dynamic, fair, and transparent system:

- **Dynamic APR**: The more users stake, the lower the APR, creating a fair and decentralized incentive structure.
- **Weighted Time Average Rewards**: Rewards are calculated dynamically based on time-weighted averages, ensuring fairness.
- **Flexible Staking**: Investors can stake and unstake flexibly, with APR adjusting in real time based on the total staking pool.
- **Enhanced Bifrost Integration**: By utilizing Bifrost's vAsset technology, project owners will continue earn vAsset APY of the staked vAsset while the stakers participating in the launchpool. This means:
  - **No wasted funds or time**: Stakers earn interest rewards from [this platform name], stakers vAsset are redirected to Bifrost as soon as they stake, vAssets interest rewards from Bifrost will transferred to project owners to enhance shareholder value and liquidity.
  - **Win-win model**: Investors trade vAssets interest rewards for project tokens, creating dynamic opportunities to grow portfolios and enhance liquidity. while project owners gain liquidity to boost token holders, ecosystem participants, with vAssets interest reward to keep on building their project.

### 2. **Premarket Trading**

Our premarket feature allows users to trade project tokens before public listing, enhancing vAsset activity and liquidity:

- **Secure Token Trading**: Both buyers and sellers provide collateral to ensure transaction security.
- **Timely Settlements**: Sellers must deposit project tokens into the smart contract within 24 hours. If they fail, the buyer receives both parties' collateral.
- **Use Case for vAsset**: Premarket trading provides another layer of utility for vAssets, rewarding users for staking and holding.

WestPool combines a premarket and launchpool into a single platform to create a seamless and impactful experience for both stakers and project owners. By integrating these features, we enhance liquidity and enable early token transfers, allowing projects to build a strong and engaged community from the very start. Tokens gain activity immediately upon being claimed, fostering interest and utility at an early stage.
