# Bit Frost Protocol: AI-Powered Decentralized Cross-Chain Aggregation Layer

## Overview

Bit Frost Protocol is a revolutionary decentralized aggregation layer designed to seamlessly connect multiple blockchains, enabling trustless, private, and intelligent cross-chain transactions. By leveraging advanced cryptography, artificial intelligence, and secure hardware technologies, Bit Frost Protocol solves the liquidity fragmentation problem in the blockchain ecosystem while maintaining the highest standards of security, privacy, and efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Seamlessly swap assets between different blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum).
- **AI-Powered Trading**: Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) for intelligent trade execution and market analysis.
- **Dark Pool Trading**: Execute large trades without impacting market prices or revealing trade details.
- **Limit Order Book**: Supports advanced trading strategies with a decentralized limit order book.
- **Trustless Architecture**: Utilizes Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures (FROST) for decentralized trade execution.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Implements zero-knowledge proofs and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to protect user information and trade details.
- **Lock and Mint Mechanism**: Enables seamless asset transfers across chains without the need for wrapped tokens.
- **Scalable Design**: Employs sharding and multi-processing capabilities for enhanced performance.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: tailwind, React, thirdweb
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (Ethereum), Bitcoin Script
- Cryptography: Schnorr Signatures, FROST, sp1 zk
- Secure Hardware: Intel SGX for Trusted Execution Environments Simulated

## Dark Pool Trading

Bit Frost's Dark Pool feature allows for:
- Large trade execution without market impact
- Complete privacy of trade details until settlement
- Matching of orders without revealing trader identities
- Protection against front-running and other market manipulations

## Lock and Mint Mechanism

Our innovative Lock and Mint approach:
- Locks assets on the source chain
- Mints equivalent assets on the destination chain
- Ensures 1:1 backing of all minted assets
- Allows for easy redemption and unlocking of original assets

## Decentralization and Security

Bit Frost Protocol achieves true decentralization and security through:
- FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) for distributed key management and signing
- TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) using Intel SGX for secure computation
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving verifications
- Decentralized node network for order matching and execution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Yarn or npm
- MetaMask or another Web3 wallet
- (For node operators) Intel SGX-enabled hardware

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ShivamAgarwal-code/Bit-Frost.git

2. Install dependencies:


3. Set up environment variables:



4. Run the development server:



## Usage

1. Connect your Web3 wallet to the application.
2. Choose the source and destination blockchains for your trade.
3. Enter the amount and asset you wish to trade.
4. Confirm the transaction and wait for the cross-chain swap to complete.
5. witness smpc taking place in backend
